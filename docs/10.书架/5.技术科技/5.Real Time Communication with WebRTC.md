Deliver rich audio and video teleconferencing and peer-to-peer data exchange right in the browser. With this hands-on book, you’ll learn how to use the emerging Web Real Time Communication (WebRTC) technology to build a browser-to-browser application piece by piece.

WebRTC components allow web browsers to securely access webcams and microphones and to capture media, set up audio/video calls, and share data via peer-to-peer—all without the use of plugins. The technology defines channels connecting applications running on any device.

This book’s learn-by-example approach is ideal not only for web programmers familiar with JavaScript, but also for real-time application architects who understand the inner workings of Internet protocols and communication paradigms. You’ll learn WebRTC theory and work with exercises that you can apply to your own projects.
